# Connection to the VMs subnet through the Bastion VM using Headscale

## 1. Install Tailscale on your PC

You need a Tailscale client to connect to the Headscale server running on the Bastion VM. Once you are authenticated on this Headscale server, it will be possible to access all the VMs that are connected to the same virtual switch (i.e., Linux Bridge) of the Bastion by simply using their dedicated IPs (i.e., 192.168.100.xxx). Thus, the first thing to do is to install the Tailscale client from the official [download page](https://tailscale.com/download).

Once the Tailscale client has been installed, **ignore** the banner asking to connect to the Tailscale network and **reboot**.

**Do not create a Tailscale account on the website!** You don't need it to connect to a self-hosted Headscale server, such as the one set up on B3Lab's machines.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you already have a Tailscale client running and connected to your Tailscale account, you should first disconnect it before proceeding. On Windows, you can do it by right-clicking on the Tailscale icon in the notification area, selecting your account, and then _Log out_. On Linux/MAC, open a terminal and run `tailscale logout`.
> 
> If you wish to keep both the connections to your Tailscale account and the Headscale server ready to go, simply replace the command `tailscale up` given below with `tailscale login`. This will allow you to _switch_ between the two different Tailnets when needed, using `tailscale switch --list` to show Tailnets you are logged into and `tailscale switch "<account_name>"` to change the one you are currently using. Note that you can't be connected to two distinct Tailnets simultaneously, which is why either the `tailscale logout` or `tailscale switch` strategy is required.

## 2. Check the main prerequisites

To connect to the Headscale server running on the Bastion VM, you need this information from your system admin:
- The Bastion VM IP address and Headscale server listening port (or the host's IP and forwarding port, in configurations where those are used instead).
- An _account_ that has been specifically created for you on the Headscale server running on the Bastion VM.
- A _pre-authorized key_ associated with your Headscale account. Note that **pre-authorized keys have a validity frame (usually, 30 days) that is defined at the moment of creation and cannot be extended.** If you happen to lose your key or it expires before you can connect your devices to the Headscale server, you will need to request a new pre-authorized key from the admin. The key is **_reusable_**, meaning you can use the same key to authenticate all the devices (PCs, smartphones, etc.) you will connect to the VM from.

Eventually, remember that **your PC must be connected to Politecnico's local network to communicate with the Bastion VM.** This can be achieved either by connecting through an Ethernet cable within Politecnico's facilities or by configuring the appropriate [VPN connection](https://www.ict.polimi.it/network/vpn/). Please note that **the VPN connection is needed even if you are using _polimi-protected_ WiFi** (only the Ethernet approach enables direct connection without VPN).

From your system (any OS supports the following command), check that the Bastion VM is actually reachable at the IP address provided by the system admin:
```bash
ping <IP_Bastion_VM>
```
E.g.:
```bash
ping 10.79.40.10
```
If the host is unreachable, you first need to solve this issue before proceeding (e.g., check your network/VPN connection).

## 3. Set up the connection to the Headscale server

After rebooting the system following Tailscale installation (or logging out of your Tailscale network if you were already using it), open a PowerShell/CMD (Windows) or Linux/MAC terminal. Type the following command, replacing the tags with the actual information provided by your system admin (if you are on Linux and you are **not** using a shared machine, you should execute the following with **sudo**):
```bash
tailscale up --login-server http://<IP_Bastion_VM>:<Headscale_server_listening_port> \
             --authkey <pre-authorized_key_created_for_the_user> \
             --accept-routes
```
This should look something like this (beginning with **sudo**, if the previous parenthesis applies):
```bash
tailscale up --login-server http://10.79.40.10:48080 --authkey 40474b6a18d9261c71e5ac6236473a1ea186a93fc8b257d9 --accept-routes
```

> üìù If you plan to use the `tailscale switch` method explained above, you can add the `--nickname "<account_nickname>"` option to the previous command to give the account a nickname of your choice and facilitate its selection through the _switch_ subcommand. Find an example of usage [here](https://wiki.indie-it.com/wiki/Tailscale#HowTos).

After this, your connection to the Headscale server should be up and running! Try to reach your VM or any other on the same subnet to check if the connection works as expected.
```bash
ping <IP_of_your_VM/bastion_VM>
```
For example, you can ping the IP that the bastion VM gets on that subnet to verify the connection to the subnet:
```bash
ping 192.168.100.2
```
or connect to your VM through SSH (obviously, this one will work only if your VM is on):
```bash
ssh <your_username>@<IP_of_your_VM>
ssh username@192.168.100.3
```

**Note:** The Tailscale connection to the Headscale server generally survives your system's reboots (unless you run `tailscale logout` or `tailscale down` from a terminal), thus this configuration procedure should be done only once.

### Troubleshooting for Windows users

On Windows, you may have trouble performing the [last step](https://github.com/pierreali-gerp/server-utilization/blob/main/00-connectToYourVM/00_headscale.md#3-set-up-the-connection-to-the-headscale-server), specifically connecting to the Headscale server through Tailscale. This is especially likely **if you were already using Tailscale before** attempting this procedure or **if you are trying to reach the Headscale server by going through Politecnico's Global Protect VPN**. Regarding the latter, I verified that **first-time access certainly requires an Ethernet connection from inside Politecnico, without any VPN** (I'm still unsure about subsequent connections, to be honest).

Thus, if you experience any issues connecting from Windows, the suggestion is not to waste your time trying to deal with Windows' stupidity. Instead, **install Tailscale on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and connect to your VM <ins>through</ins> it!**

To do so, after [setting up WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), installing the distro of your choice (the latest Ubuntu is the suggested one, as it is more stable than others on WSL), and ensuring you have [upgraded to WSL2 and set your distro to run with it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#upgrade-version-from-wsl-1-to-wsl-2), follow the [official instructions](https://tailscale.com/download/linux) to install Tailscale on a Linux OS (the one-liner installer is highly advised!). Then, connect to the Headscale server following the instructions above and test the connection by pinging one of the VMs on the subnet.

Once you are sure the connection to the Headscale server and the advertised subnet is working (e.g., by pinging the IP that the bastion VM gets on the subnet, as mentioned at the end of the previous section), you can either **a) connect to your VM passing through WSL** or **b) install on the WSL distro the software you need to interact with your VM**. In the following, both these strategies will be illustrated through examples. However, keep in mind that **the former usually provides a better user experience than the latter**, when it's viable.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **REMEMBER:** Since you established the connection to the Headscale server through WSL, **you can only get access to your VM by passing through WSL.** In other words, you <ins>must</ins> either install everything you need to interact with your VM on the Linux distro set up on WSL or find a way to make your connection _jump_ through WSL.

#### a) Connect to your VM through WSL (an example using Visual Studio Code)

When you need WSL to set up your Tailscale connection to the bastion, the most convenient way to allow applications on your local machine to communicate with the VM is by _routing_ their connections through your WSL distro before sending them to the VM. Although you may make this work for every communication protocol by setting up a VPN between your Windows installation and WSL, the easiest way to achieve this result for SSH connections (i.e., among the most widely adopted protocols in Linux) is by configuring an **_SSH jump_**.

For example, this is especially convenient to connect your **Visual Studio Code (VSC)** Windows application to an already-installed VSC server on your VM (more details about this kind of connection are accessible from the VSC bullet of [this list](https://github.com/pierreali-gerp/server-utilization/blob/main/00-connectToYourVM/01_interactWithYourVM.md#list-of-suggested-tools-to-access-and-work-with-your-vm)).

##### **Connecting your local Windows VSC installation to your VM's VSC server**
The idea behind this simple procedure is to let your VSC application on Windows connect to your VM by going through a first SSH connection to WSL. This way, the connection will appear to your VM as if it originated from WSL, even though you will be using VSC directly from Windows. To realize this connection, follow the instructions below.

**On WSL (with an Ubuntu distro):**
```bash
# SSH and Netcat installation (the latter is needed for SSH-jumping through the host)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ssh openssh-server netcat

# Ensure the SSH service is running and enabled
systemctl status ssh
# If it isn't:
sudo systemctl enable --now ssh

# Get WSL IP address (might change across WSL reboots, so check this every time you experience connection issues with VSC!)
ip address show eth0
```

**On Windows:**
  1. Check your local connection to the SSH server you've just enabled on WSL. From a PowerShell terminal, run `ssh <your_WSL_username>@<your_WSL_IP>`. If you can't connect, troubleshoot your SSH connection to WSL before proceeding.
  2. Install VSC from the Microsoft Store (or the source you prefer) and open it.
  3. Go to the _extensions_ tab on the left bar and install the **_Remote-SSH_** plugin.
  4. Go to the _**Remote explorer**_ tab on the left bar, move your mouse over the _SSH_ drop-down menu on the right, and select the gearwheel to access SSH configurations. Choose to modify the user configuration in _C:\Users\username\\.ssh\config_.
  5. Add the following lines to the configuration file (you can add comments by preceding them with "#"; mind the indentations!)
     ```bash
     # ProxyJump by WSL (connected to the server bastion's Headscale server through Tailscale) to reach a VM running on the EBRAINS server 
     # Reference: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SSH_jump_host#Single_jump
     ## First jump host. Directly reachable
     Host Local_WSL
       HostName <your_WSL_IP>
       User <your_username_on_WSL>
     ## Final host to jump to via the "First jump host"
     Host <a_nickname_for_your_VM>
       HostName <IP_of_your_VM>
       User <your_username_on_the_VM>
       ProxyJump Local_WSL
     ```
     An example of how your configuration file should look after adding the _jump host_ and the _final host_:
     ```bash
     Host Local_WSL
       HostName 192.168.5.142
       User wslusername
       
     Host my_VM_throughHeadscale
       HostName 192.168.100.3
       User myvmusername
       ProxyJump Local_WSL
     ```
  6. Save changes made to the SSH configuration file and click on the nickname of the **final host to reach** (in the example, _my_VM_throughHeadscale_) to establish the connection from your local VSC to the VSC server installed on the VM.

#### b) Install the software you need on WSL directly (applicable even to GUIs)
Given that [WSL seamlessly supports executing GUI applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps) since June 2025, you can now install and run any GUI you need to interact with your VM.

> üìù Note that some GUIs may manifest graphical issues when run from WSL. In such cases, it is advisable to rely on the [previous strategy](https://github.com/pierreali-gerp/server-utilization/blob/main/00-connectToYourVM/00_headscale.md#a-connect-to-your-vm-through-wsl-an-example-using-visual-studio-code) to run these applications whenever possible.

##### NoMachine
For example, it is possible to install and run **NoMachine** (for an overview on this tool, see [here](https://github.com/pierreali-gerp/server-utilization/blob/main/00-connectToYourVM/01_interactWithYourVM.md#list-of-suggested-tools-to-access-and-work-with-your-vm)) to interact with your VM from WSL:
```bash (on WSL)
# Move to your home's Downloads directory
cd Downloads/
# Download NoMachine from the website (here's the example if you have installed Ubuntu on WSL; check the updated URL for your distro here:
# https://download.nomachine.com/it/download/?id=1&platform=linux)
wget https://web9001.nomachine.com/download/9.1/Linux/nomachine_9.1.24_6_amd64.deb
# Install NoMachine using the just-uploaded installer (again, this applies to an Ubuntu WSL installation)
# NB: You will be asked if you want to add VS Code's repositories during the installation process: accept!
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ./nomachine_9.1.24_6_amd64.deb
```

Shutdown your WSL distro by running `wsl --shutdown` on PowerShell and restart it through `wsl --distribution <distro_name>` (to check which distros are already installed on your system, use `wsl --list`). Finally, run the NoMachine GUI from WSL and use it to connect to your VM:
```bash (on WSL)
/usr/NX/bin/nxplayer
```

##### Visual Studio Code (<ins>_modality a)_</ins> is suggested for this tool; this is kept here only for the record)
As a <ins>discouraged</ins> alternative to the [strategy documented above](https://github.com/pierreali-gerp/server-utilization/blob/main/00-connectToYourVM/00_headscale.md#a-connect-to-your-vm-through-wsl-an-example-using-visual-studio-code), one could also install **VSC** directly on WSL to connect to the VSC server already configured on the VM. To install VSC on WSL, follow the [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux#_install-vs-code-on-linux) specific to your Linux distro. In particular, you can run the following commands from WSL's terminal to save the installer to your home's Downloads folder and perform the installation:
```bash (on WSL)
# Move to your home's Downloads directory
cd Downloads/
# Download the VSC installer from the website (here's the example if you have installed Ubuntu on WSL;
# check the updated link on the instructions page above)
wget https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=760868 -O vscode_installer.deb
# Install VSC on Ubuntu from the downloaded .deb package
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ./vscode_installer.deb
```

After installing VSC, start it by simply typing `code` in the WSL terminal (if a prompt appears, agree to proceed anyway). If this doesn't work the first time, shut down and restart your WSL distro first, as illustrated at the end of the instructions for NoMachine.
